# Simple-Search-Engine
### About:
Create your own search engine! It probably won’t compete with Google: yours will be a simple version which processes some data and searches it for a word or a phrase. Simple but cool.
### Learning outcomes
Gain confidence in working with files and console, and learn how to optimize the search process.
### This project is a part of the following track
Kotlin Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/6: String theory
Set two strings (where to search and what to search) for the program to return an index of the searched word or report “not found”
### Stage 2/6: Expand the search
With the help of arrays and linear search, add more strings to the program and search for specific data from that input.
### Stage 3/6: User menu
Using switch operator and methods, create a user menu for your search engine
### Stage 4/6: X-files
Enable your search engine to search for data stored in the files
### Stage 5/6: Inverted Index search
Working with lists and maps, build the inverted index to enhance your search
### Stage 6/6: Search strategies
Get familiar with patterns and learn to deal with more complex types of search
